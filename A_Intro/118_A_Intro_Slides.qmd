Cool! But what about this might make it hard to reproduce? 

## Tools for this course {.smaller}

#### R 
::: {.incremental}
- R is a free & open-source programming language
- Think “big fancy calculator”
:::

#### RStudio 

::: {.incremental}
- An Integrated Development Environment for working w/ R 
- it makes it easier to write R code, work with objects, prepare & publish documents all in one place
:::

#### Quarto 

::: {.incremental}
- Quarto is a file format for making dynamic documents -- documents that content text and chunks of embedded R code
- Think Word Document or Google Doc with code in it

:::{.incremental}
- Each class we will have a lesson (30-40 minutes) and time to work on your daily homework assignments (30 - 40 minutes)
- Midterm Project
- Final Project
